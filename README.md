ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Ville Mustonen, a software developer focused on creative coding solutions.

Iâ€™m in the final stages of my studies at Hive Helsinki, where Iâ€™ve honed my skills in C and C++. I'm passionate about front-end development and have a keen eye for UI/UX design, often leveraging JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for building engaging user interfaces. My recent projects include everything from improving game mechanics in C++ to building mobile-compatible web applications.

Iâ€™m currently exploring opportunities in full-stack and front-end development, with a focus on mastering React, TypeScript, and Node.js. My background also includes hands-on experience with telecommunication systems and electrical installations, giving me a unique edge in tech and fieldwork alike.

- ðŸš€ Skills: C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Advanced React & TypeScript
- ðŸ’¼ Looking for: Junior front-end or full-stack roles
